# NI Task API


Steps
------
- [Set up](#set-up)
- [Configuring Database](#configuring-database)
- [Configuring The Test Process and Running The Test](#configuring-the-test-process-and-running-the-test)


Set up
------
First, build docker container and run:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Install composer packages
```bash
docker-compose run --rm app composer install
```

copy .env.example to .env file and generate app key
```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose run --rm app php artisan key:generate
```

Configuring Database
------
Run migration and seeders
```bash
docker-compose run --rm app php artisan migrate --seed
```


Configuring The Test Process and Running The Test
------
First, create sqlite database
```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Run migration and seeders for testing
```bash
docker-compose run --rm app php artisan migrate --seed --env=testing
```

Run tests
```bash
docker-compose run --rm app php artisan test 
```

How to use the API
------
API requests must include _api_. For example the root of the API is at _/api_.

__Valid API request__
```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost/api/products'
```
>You can use  [Postman collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datcal/NITask/main/NITask.postman_collection.json "NITask Postman Collection") for testing.

Personal Notes
------
If a user places an order for the same item multiple times and wants to cancel only one of these items, 
this is not possible using the current structure. 
My suggestion would be to create a unique key for each one of the orders and for each item in those orders,
and carry out all communications through this key.
